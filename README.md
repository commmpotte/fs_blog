# Full-Stack Blog Application
## UNDER MAINTENANCE FOR A WHILE, SORRY
## Introduction

Welcome to my Full-Stack Blog Application! This application is designed to function as a blog, where users can read and create articles. It includes features like user registration and login, as well as the ability for authors to delete or edit their own posts.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to the application, allowing them to create, edit, and delete their own blog posts.

2. **Article Management**: Authors can create new blog posts, edit existing ones, and delete posts they no longer wish to keep.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend of this application is built using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.

- **Backend**: The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, which serve as the server for handling user requests and managing data.
My backend repo is here: https://github.com/commmpotte/fs_blog_back

- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database to store blog articles and user information securely.

- **Authentication**: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure routes and user data.

## Deployment

This application is deployed on Heroku for the backend and Vercel for the frontend, making it accessible to users from anywhere.

## Future Enhancements

This is just the initial version of the application. In future updates, the following features will be added:

- **Comments**: Users will be able to write and view comments on each blog post.

- **Image Display**: Images within blog posts will be displayed correctly.

- **Tag Sorting**: Users can sort blog posts by tags.

Stay tuned for these exciting improvements!

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
